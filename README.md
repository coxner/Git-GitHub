# Git-GitHub

In short Git is a version control system that stores different versions of your files. You can think of it as a undo button. If any of your files are ever to break Git provides a reference point you can go back to.

`git init` initalizes/ creates a new git repository.

A commit can be refered to as a user created check point.

To view every commit that has ever been made in a Git we use `git log`. We can also use `git log --stat` which provides more detailed stats on files that have changed with each commit.

To view the differnce between two versions of files/commits we can use `git diff`. To find the diff between two commits we first call `git log` to obtain the commit ids we then run `git diff commit_id1 commit_id2`. To compare two files we would simply do a `git diff file_1 file _2`.

Copying the history of a git repo from one computer to another is known as cloning.

Head is what git uses to refer to the commit it is currently on.

### The Git Workflow

Git files start by being stored in the working directory. When the command `git add` is done it moves file from the working directory to the staging directory. When the command `git commit` is done it moves files from the staging area to the repository. By default the staging area contains files of the most recent commit. See the diagram below to understand this workflow.
