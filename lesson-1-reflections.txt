    If your code breaks you can easily go back and identify what broke it.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Cons are you have to manually save your code. 
    Pros are you have some pin point with Google you would have to look through
    alot of files to see which change caused the code to break..

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

could break something?

    Because if your code does break you can use checkout to go back to the
